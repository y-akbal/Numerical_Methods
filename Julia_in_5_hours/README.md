# Julia in 3 Lectures - For Numerical Analysis

This code should not be considered complete unless you think that it really is.
We are highly motivated by the repo https://github.com/JuliaCommunity/30-Days-Of-Julia.

## The Curriculum

This curriculum is designed to help beginners learn the basics of programming using the Julia programming language. The curriculum, of course subject to change depending on our pace, designed as the follows .

- Introduction to Julia and the REPL
- Basic data types and operators
- Control flow and functions
- Types and type annotations
- Working with arrays and dictionaries
- Some syntactic sugar 
- Error handling and debugging
- Modules and packages
- Working with files and streams
- Structs -- Static Arrays -- Some Advanced Stuff
- Working with data structures and algorithms
- Working with threads and concurrency

I plan to cover these stuff in probably two or three lecture hours, including lab assignments.
